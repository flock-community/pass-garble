# Pass Garble MacOS Example implementation

This example shows how to integrate a kotlin multiplatform library into a MacOS application


## Getting started
The integration with the example project is done through the [Cocoapods dependency manager](https://cocoapods.org/)
To get started: 

1. Run a full build of the root project (`./gradle build` should do the trick)
2. Run `pod install` in the current directory
3. Open the workspace instead of the project: `open PassGarbleMac.xcworkspace`
